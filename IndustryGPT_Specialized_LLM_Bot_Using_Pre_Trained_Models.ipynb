        "This project focuses on building a domain-specific AI chatbot for e-commerce customer support by fine-tuning the T5 transformer model and deploying it via a lightweight web interface using Streamlit and ngrok. The aim is to provide quick, automated, and accurate responses to frequently asked customer queries such as order tracking, delivery options, return/exchange policies, and payment methods.\n",
        "\n",
        "The chatbot is based on the t5-small model from HuggingFace Transformers, which is known for its text-to-text generation capability. It is trained on a custom dataset tailored specifically for customer service scenarios. The dataset is structured with input prompts in the format \"User: <question>\\nBot:\" and the corresponding expected response. This ensures the model learns not just the content but the conversational structure required for role-based interactions.\n",
        "\n",
        "To prepare the dataset, each example was tokenized using the T5 tokenizer with padding and truncation applied to standardize input lengths. The preprocessing logic was carefully designed to avoid repetition of prefixes such as \"prompt:\" to maintain clarity in the training data. The fine-tuning was conducted using the HuggingFace Trainer API within Google Colab. Key hyperparameters such as the number of training epochs (set to 50) and learning rate (1e-4) were adjusted to improve model convergence and response quality.\n",
        "\n",
        "During evaluation, the model initially faced challenges such as blank or irrelevant responses. These issues were resolved by refining the prompt structure, increasing the number of training epochs, and removing unsupported generation parameters like temperature and top_p for greedy decoding. After fine-tuning, the model showed improved performance and was able to generate relevant and fluent answers to various test inputs from the e-commerce domain.\n",
        "\n",
        "For deployment, a Streamlit-based web interface was developed that allows users to interact with the chatbot in real-time. The app takes user input, processes it through the fine-tuned model, and displays the response immediately. Since Google Colab does not support web hosting, pyngrok was integrated to create a secure public tunnel that exposes the Streamlit app to the internet. This setup enables full interaction with the chatbot from any device without requiring backend hosting infrastructure.\n",
        "\n",
        "The final application provides a functional prototype of an AI assistant capable of handling routine customer queries. It has potential real-world applications in small to medium-sized e-commerce platforms where human customer service may be limited. Future enhancements could include multilingual support, intent classification, user history tracking, and integration with real databases for dynamic responses.\n",
        "\n",
        "In summary, this project demonstrates how transformer-based NLP models can be effectively fine-tuned for narrow domains and deployed using accessible tools like Streamlit and Google Colab. It offers a practical, scalable, and cost-efficient solution to enhance customer service through automation.\n",
